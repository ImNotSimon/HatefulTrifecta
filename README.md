# HatefulTrifecta
Code for the ULTRAKILL mod, "Hateful Trifecta". Uses code from Envy &amp; Spite level loader/editor.

Some of the code here belongs to @Minepool9

A lot of the code here may have signs of decompilation, as I lost the source code at one point and had to run it through dnSpyEx.

There might be a LOT of unused code lying around. It's a big mess.
